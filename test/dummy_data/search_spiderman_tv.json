  "overview": "Italian Spiderman is a film parody of Italian actionâ€“adventure films of the 60s and 70s, first released on YouTube in 2007. The parody purports to be a \"lost Italian film\" by Alrugo Entertainment, an Australian film-making collective formed by Dario Russo, Tait Wilson, David Ashby, Will Spartalis and Boris Repasky.\n\nOstensibly an Italian take on the comic book superhero Spider-Man, the film is a reference to foreign movies that misappropriate popular American superheroes such as the Turkish film \"3 Dev Adam\" and the Japanese TV series \"Spider-Man\", both of which alter the character of Spider-Man for foreign audiences. Other notable entries include the Indian version of Superman, I Fantastici Tre Supermen and La Mujer Murcielago. It also resembles the movie The Bathman dal pianeta Eros.\n\nA trailer was released, followed by a full-length feature made up of ten mini-episodes.",

The meme consists of a screenshot taken at a random part of the series and adding an inappropriate and/or witty text. Since the death of Max Ferguson on March 7 2013, there are only three surviving members from the cast. Those three being Paul Soles the voice of Spider-Man, Chris Wiggins the voice of Mysterio and Carl Banas the voice of the Scorpion.",

The cast of The Electric Company played the roles of the various characters in each story, with another serving as narrator. In many of these sketches, viewers were addressed as \"true believers.\"\n\nUnlike other live-action and cartoon productions of Spider-Man, this version of the web-slinging hero did not speak out loud, instead communicating only with word balloons, in order to encourage young viewers to practice their reading skills because he was drawn without a mouth. He also never appeared out of his costume as Peter Parker and, given the series' budget limitations, used his web-shooters sparingly.",
